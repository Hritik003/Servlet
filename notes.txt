JSP -  Java Server Pages
whenever you use JSP, it gets converted into Servlet.


-->directive is used for importing any packages <%@page import = " java.util.*">
-->declaration is used for any declaration that is needed 

	<%!
	(which means not service) 
		int value or anything;
	%>

--> scriplet is used for the main logic 
		
		<% 
			ex: String user = request.getParameter("username");
				String pwd = request.getParameter("password");		
				out.println("You have successfully logged into your session as :" + user);
		%>		
		
--> Expression is used for  printing directly, by default it measures it as out.println <% = user%>
